## Description

Build the **pack scaffolding-recipe capability**: packs carry scaffolding
recipes (a template plus a pack-declared target path), and core applies them
via a generic, language/platform-blind mechanism — copy template to
pack-declared target, nothing more. No recipe logic, target-path convention,
or platform knowledge is baked into backstop itself; every recipe's shape and
destination is entirely pack-declared. This preserves the thin-executor
invariant (zero baked language/tool knowledge) that `backstop/self` already
enforces — a baked recipe mechanism would be exactly the kind of violation
that invariant exists to catch.

Two consumers of this capability:

1. **Language project scaffolding** — e.g. `pack add ts` bootstraps a starter
   TypeScript project via its recipe; the same mechanism works for any future
   language pack with zero core changes.
2. **CI recipe pack** — per-platform gate-workflow templates (GitHub Actions,
   etc.) that `backstop init` applies by default to wire CI gating out of the
   box.

**This directive is a blocking dependency for DIR-002 (`backstop init`
Command).** BUNDLE-003 resolved (all 7 OQs) that `backstop init` bakes zero
language/platform knowledge itself — it delegates all project scaffolding and
CI gate-workflow templating to packs via this recipe mechanism. `backstop
init`'s spec cannot be written until the recipe capability it depends on
exists, so DIR-019 must land — at least through a spec — before DIR-002's
implementation proceeds.

This directive is early: it is sourced from BUNDLE-015
(pack-scaffolding-recipes), which is still at `exploring` maturity with open
questions. The founder drives the bundle's promotion; no spec work begins
under this directive until BUNDLE-015 has progressed past `exploring`.

## Notes

Added to BACKLOG.yml immediately before DIR-002, since DIR-002 depends on
it, but after DIR-001 (Release Workflow) and DIR-003 (Baseline
Implementation) — both are also `backstop init` prerequisites and were
already prioritized ahead of DIR-002. This placement is a defensible default,
not a unilateral reprioritization; the founder should reposition if they
disagree with where this lands relative to other queued work.
